# Assembly compiler in Haskell

The goal of this project is to develop an interpreter and compiler for a small imperative language for a low-level machine with configurations of the form (***c***, ***e***, ***s***) where ***c*** is a list of instructions to be executed, ***e*** is the evaluation stack, and ***s*** is the storage.

## Instalation and Execution

To run this project, you need to:

  - Have the haskell interpreter **GHCi**. If you don't have it, you can install it [**here**](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/)
  - Download the **src** folder
  - Open a terminal, navigate to the **src** folder and run `ghci`
  - Load the `main.hs` file by writing `:l main.hs` in the **ghci**

With this, you are all set to run the code. Enjoy!

## Data Structures

We have created several different data structures to support and facilitate the development of this project. These structures include the following:


### Code

The **Inst** data type represents the intructions supported by this small imperative language. It includes the following instructions:

- Push **Integer**
- Add
- Mult
- Sub
- Tru
- Fals
- Equ
- Le
- And
- Neg
- Fetch **String**
- Store **String**
- Noop
- Branch **Code** **Code**
- Loop **Code** **Code**

The type **Code** was defined to represent the list of instructions, in other words, the code that is going to be processed.

More information on the details of each instruction [here](#instructions)


### Stack

The **StackValue** data type represents the values that compose a stack such as **Integers** and both **TT** and **FF**, which represent truth values, **True** and **False**, respectively.

The type **Stack** represents an ordinary stack, composed of **StackValues**, in this case.<br>

We also created 3 functions pertaining to the **Stack**:

- `stackValueToString :: StackValue -> String`. This function utilizes pattern-matching to differentiate how to map a **StackValue** to a printable value on the terminal.
- `createEmptyStack :: Stack`. Very self-explanatory, creates an empty stack.
- `stack2Str :: Stack -> String`. This function iterates through the stack and prints it to the terminal. We used the **intercalate** function in the **Data.List** module to facilitate this.


### State

The **State** type represents the internal storage where variables are stored. To implement this type we used a **HashMap**, which receives a **Key**, which is a string, and a **Value**, which is a **StackValue**.

We created 4 functions pertaining to the **State**:

- `pairToString :: (String, StackValue) -> String`. This functions is similar to the `stackValueToString` function, where its goal is to map a pair from the **State** to a printable value on the terminal, using pattern-matching.
- `createEmptyState :: State`. Also very self-explanatory, creates an empty state using the `HashMap.empty` function
- `insertIntoState :: Key -> Value -> State -> State`. This function calls the `HashMap.insert` function to insert a Key Value pair into the state
- `lookupState :: String -> State -> Maybe Value`. This function calls the `HashMap.lookup` function to look up a key in the **State**. If it exists, it returns its respective value, otherwise throws a **Run-time error**
- `state2Str :: State -> String`. Similar to the `stack2Str` function. Iterates through the state and prints it to the terminal.


### Program

To represent the **Program** to be compiled we created several different data types, namely **Aexp**, which represents **Arithmetic** expressions, **Bexp**, which represents **Boolean** expressions, and **Stm**, which represents the statements of this imperative language, **Assign**, **If** and **While**.

The **Aexp** data type contains the following:

- Num **Integer**, which represents a number
- Var **String**, which represents a variable
- AddExp **Aexp** **Aexp**, which represents the addition of two other Arithmetic expressions
- SubExp **Aexp** **Aexp**, which represents the subtraction of two other Arithmetic expressions
- MultExp **Aexp** **Aexp**, which represents the multiplication of two other Arithmetic expressions

The **Bexp** data type contains the following:

- Tr, which represents TT, or True
- Fls, which represents FF, or False
- Not **Bexp**, which represents the negation of another Boolean expression
- AndExp **Bexp** **Bexp**, which represents the logical **AND** operation between two Boolean expressions
- LeExp **Aexp** **Aexp**, which represents the ***less than or equal*** comparison between two Arithmetic expressions
- EquExp **Bexp** **Bexp**, which represents the ***equality*** comparison between two Boolean expressions, e.g True = True
- DoubleEqu **Aexp** **Aexp**, which represents the ***equality*** comparison between two Arithmetic expressions, e.g 1 == 1

The **Stm** data type contains the following:

- Assign **String** **Aexp**, which represents the variable assignment operation, e.g y:= 1+2
- If **Bexp** **Program** **Program**, which represents an If Then Else statement, e.g If (x<=1) Then x:=0 Else x:=2 
- While **Bexp** **Program**, which represents a While Do statement, e.g While (True) Do x:= x + 1

The **Program** type is a list of statements.

## Interpreter

To implement the interpreter for this imperative language, we applied pattern-matching to the run function, checking the head of the **Code** list for every possible instruction and executing it accordingly.

We also used the same pattern-matching strategy to check if the stack had invalid arguments for a certain instruction, and if so we throw a **Run-time error**.

For example, here is the **Le** run function:

```haskell
run (Le:remainingCode, IntValue i1:IntValue i2:stack, state) = run (remainingCode, value:stack, state)
    where value = if i1 <= i2 then TT else FF
run (Le:remainingCode, _:_:stack, state) = error "Run-time error"
```

Because **Le** uses the two topmost values of the stack, which have to be **IntValue**, the main function that is going to execute the **Le** instruction is the first pattern-matching, which contains **Le** at the top of the **Code** list, meaning it is the next instruction to be processed, and the stack contains **IntValue** i1 and **IntValue** i2 at the top. In this case, we recursively call **run** again with the remaning code and with a new stack, with its topmost element depending on wether or not i1 is less than or equal to i2.

If this pattern for the **Le** run function does not match, it means the two topmost values of the stack are not both **IntValues**, in that case we call the **error** function with the "**Run-time error**" string.

### Instructions 

The following is every instruction along with a more in-depth explanation of how it works:

- The `add` function adds the top two integer values of the stack and pushes the result onto the top of the stack.
- The `mult` function multiplies the top two integer values of the stack and pushes the result onto the top of the stack.
- The `sub` function subtracts the topmost element of the stack with the second topmost element of the stack, and pushes the result onto the top of the stack.
- The `eq` function compares the equality of the top two values of the stack, both integers and boolean, and pushes a boolean with the comparison result onto the top of the stack. If they are equal, TT will be pushed to the stack, otherwise FF will be pushed.
- The `le` function determines whether the topmost stack element is less or equal to the second topmost element, and pushes a boolean with the comparison result onto the top of the stack. If it is, TT will be pushed to the stack, otherwise FF will be pushed.
- The `and` function which pops the two topmost elements on the stack and pushes onto the stack the result of the logical ***AND*** operation. This only works for booleans.
- The `neg` function pops the topmost element on the stack and pushes onto the stack the negation of that element. This only works for booleans.
- The `push-n` function pushes a constant value n onto the stack; true and false push the constants TT and FF, respectively, onto the stack.
- The `fetch-x` function pushes the value bound to **x** onto the stack, with **x** being a variable in the **Storage**, a.k.a **State**
- The `store-x` function pops the topmost element of the stack and updates the **state** so that the popped value is bound to **x**
- The `branch(c1,c2)` function branches the code flow depending on the topmost value of the stack. If the top of the stack is the value **TT** (that is, some boolean expression has been evaluated to true), then the stack is popped and **c1** is to be executed next. Otherwise, if the top element of the stack is **FF**, then it will be popped and **c2** will be executed next. If the top of the stack is not a truth value, the machine will halt as there is no next configuration (since the meaning of branch(···,···) is not defined in that case)
- The `loop(c1,c2)` function can be interpreted as a **while** loop. The semantics of this instruction are defined by rewriting it to a combination of other constructs, including the branch instruction and itself. For example, `loop(c1, c2)` may be transformed into `c1 ++ [branch([c2, loop(c1, c2)], [noop])]`.
- The `noop` function returns the **Stack** and **State**.

## Compiler

With the compiler, we also used pattern-matching for each type of expression. The following is the example of the `compB` function, which handles the compiling of the boolean expressions, after the code has been parsed:

```haskell
compB :: Bexp -> Code
compB Tr = [Tru]
compB Fls = [Fals]
compB (Not bexp) = compB bexp ++ [Neg]
compB (AndExp b1 b2) = compB b2 ++ compB b1 ++ [And]
compB (LeExp a1 a2) = compA a2 ++ compA a1 ++ [Le]
compB (EquExp a1 a2) = compB a2 ++ compB a1 ++ [Equ]
compB (DoubleEqu a1 a2) = compA a2 ++ compA a1 ++ [Equ]
```

As we can see, the `compB` receives a boolean expression **Bexp** and maps it to the correct instruction to be ran by the interpreter.

Also, because the **stack** is **Last-In-First-Out**, we need to first compute the second expression and only then the first. This is not noticeable in the **And** or **Equ** expressions, but it is regarding **Le**. Since 43 <= 44, for example, will first push to the stack 43 and then 44, if not computed in reverse order, the **Le** interpreter function would compute 44 <= 43, since **Le** checks if the topmost element of the stack is less than or equal to the second topmost element, not the other way around. By computing the expressions in reverse order we circunvent this issue. 

Also, because the operator to check the equality of Integer values and booleans is different, "==" and "=" respectively, we needed to create different expressions, as seen in **DoubleEqu** and **EquExp**.
Although both expressions call upon the **Equ** interpreter function, **EquExp** is used to compare boolean expressions, while **DoubleExp** is used to compare arithmetic expressions.

The main `compile` function looks like this:

```haskell
compile :: Program -> Code
compile program = concatMap compileStm program
    where
        compileStm :: Stm -> Code
        compileStm (Assign var aexp) = compA aexp ++ [Store var]
        compileStm (If bexp stm1 stm2) = compB bexp ++ [Branch (compile stm1) (compile stm2)]
        compileStm (While bexp program) = [Loop (compB bexp) (compile program)]
```

Here, we use the `concatMap` function to map and concatenate every statement in the program using the `compileStm` function.

The `compileStm :: Stm -> Code` function takes a statement and correctly maps it to its respective interpreter function, calling upon the other compiler functions, `compA` and `compB`, to process the arithmetic and boolean expressions.

### Parser

To parse the source code, firstly we developed the `lexer` function, to separate the code into different tokens:

```haskell
lexer :: String -> [String]
lexer [] = []
lexer (':' : '=' : restStr) = ":=" : lexer restStr
lexer ('<' : '=' : restStr) = "<=" : lexer restStr
lexer ('=' : '=' : restStr) = "==" : lexer restStr
lexer ('>' : '=' : restStr) = ">=" : lexer restStr
lexer ('=' : restStr) = "=" : lexer restStr
lexer ('(' : restStr) = "(" : lexer restStr
lexer (')' : restStr) = ")" : lexer restStr
lexer ('+' : restStr) = "+" : lexer restStr
lexer ('-' : restStr) = "-" : lexer restStr
lexer ('*' : restStr) = "*" : lexer restStr
lexer ('/' : restStr) = "/" : lexer restStr
lexer ('<' : restStr) = "<" : lexer restStr
lexer ('>' : restStr) = ">" : lexer restStr
lexer ('&' : restStr) = "&" : lexer restStr
lexer ('|' : restStr) = "|" : lexer restStr
lexer ('!' : restStr) = "!" : lexer restStr
lexer ('&':'&': restStr) = "&&" : lexer restStr
lexer ('|':'|': restStr) = "||" : lexer restStr
lexer (ch : restStr)
        | ch `elem` " +-*;()=" = if ch == ' ' then lexer restStr else [ch] : lexer restSTr
        | otherwise = let (word, rest) = span (`notElem` " +-*;()=") (ch : restStr) 
            in case rest of
                (':':'=':rest) -> word : "=" : lexer rest
                _ -> word : lexer rest
```

For cases where operators are composed of more than 1 character, such as the assignment operator "**:=**", we used pattern-matching to manually concatenate the characters into a single one.

For simplicity's sake, we created a type `Parser`:

```haskell
type Parser a = [String] -> a
```

This type generalizes the function type for the auxiliary parser functions, and allows us to write functions like:

```haskell
parseAexp :: Parser Aexp
parseBexp :: Parser Bexp
```

This helps make the function types a little clearer and more readable.


We broke down the parsing into different functions, for specific statements and expressions:

- The main helper function, `parseProgram`
- For parsing arithmetic expressions, we created `parseAexp`
- For parsing boolean expressions, we created `parseBexp`
- For parsing if statements, we created `parseIf`
- For parsing while statements, we created `parseWhile`
- For parsing assignment statements, we created `parseAssign`
- Finally, the root function `parse`, which calls the `lexer` function on the program code and passes the list of tokens to the `parseProgram` function

The generalized flow of code starts in the `parseProgram` function where it takes into account 3 diferent cases:

- The statement is an If Then Else, in which case we call the `parseIf` function
- The statement is a While Do, in which case we call the `parseWhile` function
- The statement is an assignment, in which case we call the `parseAssign` function

We do this because these statements need to be parsed differently, since they are composed of different code blocks. Since the If and While statements contain blocks of code inside them, it means there is a possibility of nesting code blocks, in which case we needed to implement a recursive way to process the code inside these code blocks while taking into account that they could have If and While statements themselves.

#### ParseIf

The `parseIf` function divides the code string into 4 segments:

- **ifStm**, which contains the boolean expression evaluted inside the if block
- **thenStm**, which pertains to the code block inside the **then**
- **elseStm**, which pertains to the code block inside the **else**
- **next**, which represents the rest of the code to be processed after the **IfThenElse**


For the purpose of dividing the **then** and **else** we created a helper function `breakOnElse` that finds where the **else** code block begins. Then, to determine where the **else** code block ends (in case it has more than one statement) we created the `breakOnParenthesis` function that finds the closing parenthesis of the **else** code block. We do this because, if the **else** code block has more than 1 statement, the statements are enclosed inside parenthesis.

#### ParseWhile

Our approach to the **while** statement is similar, although slightly simpler. Unlike the **IfThenElse**, where there are 2 code blocks, with the **while** statement we just needed to call the `breakOnParenthesis` function to determine the end of the **do** code block.

#### ParseAexp and ParseBexp

The implementation of the `parseAexp` and `parseBexp` functions are quite similar to each other. They check the list of tokens in reverse order of priority, meaning they look for the lowest priority tokens first. Following is the implementation of the `parseAexp` function:

```haskell
parseAexp :: Parser Aexp
parseAexp tokens = case nextValidAToken (tokens,[]) "+" of
    (firstSegment, "+":secondSegment) -> AddExp (parseAexp firstSegment) (parseAexp secondSegment)
    _ -> case nextValidAToken (tokens,[]) "-" of
        (firstSegment, "-":secondSegment) -> SubExp (parseAexp firstSegment) (parseAexp secondSegment)
        _ -> case nextValidAToken (tokens,[]) "*" of
            (firstSegment, "*":secondSegment) -> MultExp (parseAexp firstSegment) (parseAexp secondSegment)
            _ -> case break isAllNumbers (reverse tokens) of
                (_, number:firstSegment) | check (reverse firstSegment) -> Num (read number)
                _ -> case break isAllLetters (reverse tokens) of
                    (_, name:firstSegment) | check (reverse firstSegment) -> Var name
                    _->case break (== "(") (reverse tokens) of
                        (middleAfter, "(":_) -> case break (==")") (reverse middleAfter) of
                            (middle, ")":_) -> parseAexp middle
```

For every token, we use a **case of**, where, if the token has been found, we add the respective instruction to the list of instructions to be compiled, with the according operands.
If the token has not been found, we call another **case of** to find the next token.<br>
We repeat this process until we have exhausted every possibility. This way, the functions have a cascading **case of** implementation.<br> 
To help with finding the tokens, we created a helper function called `nextValidToken`, which checks the code for the next instance of a token, passed as input, that isn't inside parenthesis. 

In the priority list, when it comes to finding operations that don't have dependencies, as in instructions with no recursive callback, such as single numbers (**Num i**) or True (**Tr**), for example, we created a faster alternative function called `check`:

```haskell
check :: [String] -> Bool
check = (== 0) . foldl updateCount 0
  where
    updateCount count "(" = count + 1
    updateCount count ")" = max 0 (count - 1)
    updateCount count _   = count
```

`check` is a simple helper function that checks for balanced parenthesis, essentially keeping count of the **depth** of parenthesis. After it finishes iterating through the list, if the **count** is larger than 0, it means we are currently at a different **depth** than the code that was being processed.

Finally, after all other tokens have been exhausted, we check for the parenthesis and recursively repeat this process for the code inside them. 


In the end, after the code has successfully been parsed, it is sent to the `compile` function to map the expressions to their respective instructions to be processed by the interpreter.
